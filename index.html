						<p>
							An old Lion, whose teeth and claws were so worn that it was not so easy for him to get food as in his younger days, pretended that he was sick. 
							He took care to let all his neighbors know about it, and then lay down in his cave to wait for visitors. And when they came to offer him their sympathy, he ate them up one by one.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Fox came too, but he was very cautious about it. Standing at a safe distance from the cave, he inquired politely after the Lion's health. 
							The Lion replied that he was very ill indeed, and asked the Fox to step in for a moment. But Master Fox very wisely stayed outside, thanking the Lion very kindly for the invitation.
						</p>
						<p> 
							"I should be glad to do as you ask," he added, "but I have noticed that there are many footprints leading into your cave and none coming out. 
							Pray tell me, how do your visitors find their way out again?"

						<h4 class="hero-heading">The Monkey & the Cat</h4>
						<p>
							Once upon a time a Cat and a Monkey lived as pets in the same house. They were great friends and were constantly in all sorts of mischief together. What they seemed to think of more than anything else was to get something to eat, and it did not matter much to them how they got it.
						</p>
						<p>
							One day they were sitting by the fire, watching some chestnuts roasting on the hearth. How to get them was the question.
						</p>
						<p>  
							"I would gladly get them," said the cunning Monkey, "but you are much more skillful at such things than I am. Pull them out and I'll divide them between us."

					Pussy stretched out her paw very carefully, pushed aside some of the cinders, and drew back her paw very quickly. Then she tried it again, this time pulling a chestnut half out of the fire. A third time and she drew out the chestnut. This performance she went through several times, each time singeing her paw severely. As fast as she pulled the chestnuts out of the fire, the Monkey ate them up.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now the master came in, and away scampered the rascals, Mistress Cat with a burnt paw and no chestnuts. From that time on, they say, she contented herself with mice and rats and had little to do with Sir Monkey.

							Mother Goat was going to market one morning to get provisions for her household, which consisted of but one little Kid and herself.
						</p>
						<p>
							"Take good care of the house, my son," she said to the Kid, as she carefully latched the door. "Do not let anyone in, unless he gives you this password: 'Down with the Wolf and all his race!'"
						</p>
						<p> 
							Strangely enough, a Wolf was lurking near and heard what the Goat had said. So, as soon as Mother Goat was out of sight, up he trotted to the door and knocked.
						</p>
						<p>   
							"Down with the Wolf and all his race," said the Wolf softly.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="one-half column">
						<p>   
							It was the right password, but when the Kid peeped through a crack in the door and saw the shadowy figure outside, he did not feel at all easy.
						</p>
						<p>   
							"Show me a white paw," he said, "or I won't let you in."
						</p>
						<p> 
							A white paw, of course, is a feature few Wolves can show, and so Master Wolf had to go away as hungry as he had come.
						</p>
						<p>    
							"You can never be too sure," said the Kid, when he saw the Wolf making off to the woods.
